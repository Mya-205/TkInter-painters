# TkInter-painters

This code calculates the cost of paint for 4 walls

It asks for the users name and email, and then the height and the 4 legnths of the walls
It then asks what paint they prefer, out of Economy, Standard and Luxury, which costs in order £0.60, £1.00 and £1.90 per square metre.
It then gives them the choice of undercoat, which costs an extra £0.50 per square metre.


It then comes up with a text box which tells them the total area, and the total price.
